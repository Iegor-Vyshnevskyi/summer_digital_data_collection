# Research Workshop on Computational Tools for Digital Data Collection

* **Instructor(s)**: Jae Yeon Kim
* **Date**: 5/19, 5/20, 5/26, 5/27 11 AM - 1 PM (KST)
* **Location**: Zoom (Institute of Politics, Korea University)

**Description**

The focus of this workshop is on digital data collection using R. The workshop consists of four parts. The first session introduces computational social science and the workflow of digital data collection within the frame of tidyverse. The following three sessions will introduce advanced techniques in social media scraping, pdf scraping, and web-scraping. 

The objective of this workshop is practical: participants will develop and execute data collections strategies in each of the three thematic modules, with the final deliverable being three complete and clean datasets. Ideally, I will expect participants involved in the workshop to identify resources---e.g., administrative databases, archival documents, social media accounts---that they wish to scrape.

> **Note**

This course is a remix version of the workshop that I co-taught with Nick Kuipers (Berkeley PhD; currently a postdoc at Stanford) at Berkeley in 2020. I also thank Justin Ho (Academia Sinica) for sharing his teaching materials on the Twitter academic API co-authored with Christopher Barrie (Edinburgh).
